# FoxBot

Telegram bot for easily collecting furry images from multiple sites.

It also supports ways of sourcing images including through sending images
directly to the bot, using commands in groups, automatically adding sources to
images posted in groups, or editing messages in channels to include the source.

It currently supports a number of sites:

* FurAffinity (including source finding via [FuzzySearch])
* Mastodon
* Weasyl
* Twitter
* e621 (finds original link from direct image links)
* direct links

It also supports trying to reverse image search images sent directly using
[FuzzySearch].

For more details, see the [blog post](https://syfaro.net/blog/foxbot/)
explaining all the features.
